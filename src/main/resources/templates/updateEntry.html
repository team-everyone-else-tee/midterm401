<!-- What if we made this message popup as like a warning before updating? It seems a bit out of place as is-->
<!--I agree that's a pretty rad Idea. here is a solution for one the user can opt to open or close using just CSS and HTML found at https://ctrlq.org/code/20083-modal-popup-css-->

           reasons you'd want to go back and update your entries. We ask that you take a moment to reflect and confirm that
           editing this entries content is in your best interest </p>
